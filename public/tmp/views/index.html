            <pre>  The "Equation of Time" is a formula to align solar time with clock time.&#x000A;So who would care if you don't use a sundial to find out the time?&#x000A;When I first started to research this a few years ago that was not my intent.&#x000A;I wanted to know how to calculate sunrise and sunset. My intent was to find&#x000A;or write a program that would do that because I got lazy about putting up&#x000A;and taking down the "Red, White, and Blue". You may just keep it up if you&#x000A;display it with a light at night. But then when to turn that on and off?&#x000A;I had a program written by a radio amateur written in BASIC but was kind&#x000A;of hard for me to get it accurate enough and was kind of what they call &#x000A;spaghetti code. But I was able to get it to use a port to switch the light &#x000A;on and off. But then I had to figure out when the computer had to turn on &#x000A;and off. Well this might be a nice idea for an embedded device but I don't&#x000A;want to deal with patents and all. So go ahead and make one for me please.&#x000A;&#x000A;  I found that the "Equation of Time" was needed to complete these calculations.&#x000A;It all made sense when you realize that you need equal amounts of daylight &#x000A;from noon to daybreak and from noon to nightfall. But when does "Noon" for &#x000A;your location actually occur? Keep this in mind as you read further.</pre>

            <pre>  Looking at the graph above you'll see three wave forms. The two dashed&#x000A;wave forms sum together to form the solid wave form. Notice that one occurs&#x000A;at a single cycle of change. This is the Ecliptic cycle. It's caused by the tilt &#x000A;of the Earth spinning on its' axis making the Sun appear higher and lower in&#x000A;the sky at different seasons.</pre>
            <pre>  Again looking at the graph we see a two cycle wave form. This is the Elliptic&#x000A;cycle or sometimes called the orbital time change. It's the Earth orbit around &#x000A;the Sun like all the other planets. It shows how time is effected by the angle &#x000A;away from the Sun at different seasons. Notice that it crosses zero at four times&#x000A;a year. You may be familiar with these times. They are the Equinoxes of Spring and &#x000A;Fall and Solstices of Summer and Winter.</pre>
            <pre>  It's funny how the seasons show up in the orbital frame of reference. That's what&#x000A;I thought while pursuing this research. I still wonder how to explain it. I must &#x000A;be thinking about that Ecliptic of the path in the sky. But the Sun only crosses &#x000A;that imaginary Celestial Equator twice a year and is not a graph of time but of &#x000A;solar altitude. You could trace it from time laps photos creating what is known&#x000A;as an Analemma. There's a link on here for that so read on.</pre>
            <pre>  Your longitude is needed first to calculate what is termed "Mean local noon".&#x000A;If you are west of the Greenwich Prime Meridian then your longitude has a &#x000A;minus sign. If you are east of the Greenwich Prime Meridian then your &#x000A;longitude has a positive sign.( not needed though )   &#x000A;&#x000A;  Longitude can be converted to a time by just dividing it by 15.0.      &#x000A;Your longitude converted to time will tell you your Mean local noon.&#x000A;        &#x000A;  local_mean_noon = noon_utc - longitude / 15.0.&#x000A;&#x000A;  Example: You are at 75.324 degrees longitude west = - 75.324&#x000A;&#x000A;  local_mean_noon = 12 - (-75.342 / 15.0)&#x000A;  local_mean_noon = 12 - (-5.0228)&#x000A;  local_mean_noon = 12 + 5.0228&#x000A;  local_mean_noon = 17.0228 (hours UTC)</pre>
            <pre>UTC is the reference Time Zone throughout the world and so is often called&#x000A;"zulu" time for the Zero time zone.      &#x000A;&#x000A;The "Equation of Time" is then subtracted from your "Mean Noon Time".&#x000A;&#x000A;This is what you may see at the top of the graph above but &#x000A;pay careful attention to the sign.      &#x000A;&#x000A;Lets say that True - Mean = - 4 minutes and 40 seconds. ( -0.0777778 ) hr.&#x000A;&#x000A;  Example : local_mean_noon = 17.0228 (hours UTC)&#x000A;&#x000A;  local_noon = 17.0228 - ( -0.0777778 ) &#x000A;  local_noon = 17.0228 + 0.0777778 &#x000A;  local_noon = 17.1005778 (hours UTC.)&#x000A;&#x000A;Note: This time is in decimal format. You will have to convert it.</pre>
            <pre>  This will be the actual clock time of your "True Solar Transit Time".      &#x000A;This time can then be converted to your time zone by adding your zone offset.&#x000A;&#x000A;Example : - 5 if West or + 5 if East of the Prime Meridian by 5 time zones.      &#x000A;&#x000A;  Now we have a reasonable place to start if we wish to calculate the sunrise      &#x000A;or sunset for your location. It works for most locations except those at or &#x000A;past the arctic circles. (+/- 90.0 latitude). Note: Of course you will want to&#x000A;know your latitude as well when it comes to calculating rise and set times.&#x000A;&#x000A;I have included methods in this Ruby gem to do exactly that.
