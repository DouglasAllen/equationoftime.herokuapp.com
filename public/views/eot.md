	using Sinatra, Haml, markdown, and of course the Ruby gem "equationoftime".  
	Without too much detail I will only attempt to describe how this Ruby gem works from
	the tutorial link above. You may also read the source code for it at github.
   
	   In case you would like to know where I got the graphic image from I renered it 
	using the same code that is R code on the image page from wikipedia equation of time.
