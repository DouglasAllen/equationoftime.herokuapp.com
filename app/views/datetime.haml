  ## What are Julian Numbers?

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Astronomers sometimes use Julian Period Day Numbers for logging of their 
  astronomical observations. But first a little history if you like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger
  Who's that? Well we have to give him credit for coming up with these numbers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day
  If that isn't enough math and terminology to make your head spin then you're going be bored
  reading the rest of this tutorial.

  I'll just sort of make a picture for you with Ruby code.
   
  ```ruby

   DateTime.jd(0,12)
   # => #{DateTime.jd(0,12)}

  ```              
%br
:markdown  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep! That's where they begin for day zero. Where are we today?

  ```ruby

   DateTime.jd(Date.today.jd,12)
   # => #{DateTime.jd(Date.today.jd,12)}
  ```              
%br
:markdown
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! You wanted to see the acctual number?

  ```ruby

   DateTime.jd
   # => #{DateTime.jd}
  ```
%br
:markdown            
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait! Didn't I just do that? Let's try again.

  ```ruby

   DateTime.now.jd
   # => #{DateTime.now.jd}
  ```
%br
:markdown           
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey! Watch what we can do with Eot class.

  ```ruby

   @solar = Eot.new
   # => #{@solar = Eot.new}

   @solar.jd
   # => #{@solar.jd}
  ```
%br
:markdown        
  The time reference we need starts at midnight UTC
  for the day but "Julian Day Numbers" begin at noon or 12:00 considering a 24
  hour day. There is only a half day difference for what is termed 
  "The Astronomical Julian Day Number" and it is the Julian Day Number with 1/2
  or 0.5 day(12 hours fractional day) subtracted. 
           
  ```ruby

   # ajd = jd - 0.5

   Date.today.jd.to_f
   # => #{Date.today.jd.to_f}

   Date.today.jd.to_f - 0.5
   # => #{Date.today.jd.to_f - 0.5}

   Date.today.ajd.to_f
   # => #{Date.today.ajd.to_f}
  ```              
%br
:markdown            
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Midnight is where we normally start counting 'Hours' for any day and it 
  just happens to be 12 hours from the International Date Line where we 
  start counting 'Days' globally. 'Time' is referenced from the Prime Meridian established at
  Greenwich, England in the late 1800s. So adding on the current time to this ajd as a fraction 
  of the day will give us the correct Julian Period Day Number for any 'Time' period of interest.
  Then all the angle calculations will be correct for the time you want them at.

  ```ruby

   DateTime.now.day_fraction
   # => #{DateTime.now.day_fraction}
  ```
%br
:markdown                    
  That's why you saw the to_f in all those methods above. We'll get into that soon.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The calculated terms used for this Ruby back-end site are done with 
  "Universal Time Coordinate" (UTC) of the current server time.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ruby we can use the Date class and many of the methods or functions
  from this class. One method used here is Date.jd( ) which gives us a 
  Julian Day Number. We can set the jd attribute for Eot class
  using an instance method of the class defined as say eot or @solar as I have used for this site.
  Hence @solar.jd=( ) is the method we can use to set the 'JD' inside the Eot class.
  This is just a convenience method for setting the @jd attribute and allows
  us to keep it handy for all the calculations that this gem will use to
  find the equation of time and rise and set sun times. 
  Use the Date.jd() or DateTime.jd() to find it first.
  (Note:) You will not need to do this if you let Eot default to today which happens on any 'new' instance ie.
  Eot.new

  ```ruby

   Eot.new.jd
   # => #{Eot.new.jd}
  ```
%br
:markdown         
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DateTime is a class included in the Ruby Standard Library Date class. 
  It can be used like the Time class to find the current time  
  ( time = Time.now ) but you will have to require 'date' lib first.   
   
  ```ruby
   
   require 'date'
         
   DateTime.now
   # => #{DateTime.now}                
  ```
%br
:markdown          
  Note: If you do this on your system it will be in local time.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that we get time in UTC there are further methods available.            
  Let's convert it to a Time class with the to_time() method as shown.
            
  ```ruby
   
   DateTime.now.class 
   # => #{DateTime.now.class}
   
   DateTime.now.to_time
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time}
   
   DateTime.now.to_time.class
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.class}
  ```
%br
:markdown       
  Note: It is still in local time or the time on the server but doesn't it look nicer now with whitespace?
         
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's make sure we have a time in UTC with utc() method.
            
  ```ruby
   
   DateTime.now.to_time.utc
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc}
  ```
%br
:markdown                            
  Do you see any difference? If the server is set at UTC it will have +0000
  on the end for local time. Universal time will show UTC on the end for it.
            
  ```ruby
   
   time = DateTime.now.to_time.utc
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc}
  ```
%br
:markdown      
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a Time class showing the real server time.
  Let's just see if we can get a valid Astronomical Julian Day Number with 
  the time as a day fraction to add on to the ajd.
  We'll get the fraction first by dividing the time by 24.0.
  But wait! Ruby will do that for us so let's just chain in some more methods. 
            
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll use the ajd() method from the DateTime class.
  But first we have to convert it back to a DateTime or Date class.
            
  ```ruby
   
   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.class
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.class}

   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_date.class
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_date.class}             
           
   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd} 

   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_date.ajd
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_date.ajd}
  ```
%br
:markdown            
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But wait! Why are these two results different? Well it is simply that the Date class
  is only for the date and so we need DateTime class if we wish to include the time also.         
      
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like we got some fractions though. These results are in the Rational class.
              
  ```ruby
   
   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.class
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.class} 
  ```
%br
:markdown               
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep! That's what Ruby does with it.
  Let's fix this by making it a Float class.
            
  ```ruby
   
   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.to_f.class
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.to_f.class}          
  ```
%br
:markdown       
  (Note:) That was just to prove it. We want the value in a Float and then
  we'll quit chaining on so many methods.
            
  ```ruby
 
   DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.to_f
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.to_f}
  ```
%br
:markdown              
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hurray! We have a fraction in decimal now and is the day fraction portion 
  which is the current time divided by 24.0 added to "The Astronomical Julian Day Number".
  Remember that? 
  
  DateTime class also gives us a method to find the day fraction ie. DateTime.day_fraction, We did
  that earlier but forgot to get our float.
  
  ```ruby
  
   Date.today.ajd.to_f
   # => #{Date.today.ajd.to_f}

   DateTime.now.day_fraction.to_f
   # => #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.day_fraction.to_f}

   Date.today.ajd.to_f + DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.day_fraction.to_f
   #{Date.today.ajd.to_f} + #{DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.day_fraction.to_f}
  ```
%br
:markdown       
  But those day fractions don't match. Well the faster the machine the closer they will be but it takes time to find them.    
            
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now let's save it in an instance of the Eot class as the @jd attribute. 
  I used @solar = Eot.new as an Object instance for this site. We used UTC time 
  for the date because it keeps it consistant when UTC could change over to the 
  next day or vice versa if you're in a different time zone. 
  But that is just how you should use this Ruby gem and is what I made sure 
  was done for this site.
            
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally set the Eot class attribute with the jd=( ) method.
        
  ```ruby     
   @solar = Eot.new
   # => #{@solar = Eot.new} # this is an Object id number 
  ```
%br
:markdown         
  Refresh the page and it 
  should change along with all the times if you needed an update.
  Note : for the gem use jd= but to find the time now use ajd in Ruby.
  All the calculations depend on @t being set and the @jd is where it comes from.
  Your noon will most likely not be UTC noon. So it's all adjusted in the gem by giving
  your longitude which we saw doesn't effect EoT but EoT effects your solar noon 
  or true solar transit.
            
  ```ruby
  
   @solar.jd = DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.to_f # from this page's Ruby:
   # => #{@solar.jd = DateTime.now.to_time.utc.to_datetime.ajd.to_f}
        
   Eot.new.jd # from the eot gem's Ruby:
   # => #{Eot.new.jd}
  ```

%br
:markdown          
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that no time is added here because a default is set for noon so that
  we may get suntimes for today right away. Remember we only need Eot for this purpose.
  But there is a method we may use to get it for the current time.
        
  ```ruby
  
   @solar.now
   # => #{@solar.now}
  ```
%br
:markdown         
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Eot in decimal minutes.
  It is used if we want to calculate all the angles for the current time. I'll explain
  all these angle calculations in the next pages. There is a method to show Eot in time format too.
  
  ```ruby
  
   @solar.string_eot
   # => #{@solar.string_eot}
  ```
%br
:markdown         
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now just keep in mind what our goals are for using this gem. We either want to 
  set the DateTime for exactly now or the Local Mean Solar Transit. (see Tutorial link)
